    <h2>Scene 5: What Happens Next?</h2>

    <p>
      the room is still hazy. the AI will be have rebooted any second. {{name}} stands slowly and looks around. people are murmuring. it's clear they've also experienced the same thing. the canister lies shattered, but the memories don't seem to have escaped. when the AI reboots, they know they're going to forget. {{name}} looks around for {{friend}} — and then back at the others. decisions need to be made.
    </p>

    <p>
      this is your story now. describe what happens next.
    </p>

    <textarea id="finalChoice" rows="10" placeholder="What does {{name}} do? Do they record the memory? Who helps them? Who stops them? Is the AI deceived? What happens to the canister?"></textarea><br><br>

    <p>
      {{name}} leaves the museum with the unsettling feeling slowly abating. something has changed, they just can’t place what. as they wait for their valet, the moonlight looks beautiful. their hands move into their pockets. they want to record their feelings again, or compose a poem, or something else. their eyes widen.
