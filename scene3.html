    <h2>Scene 3: The Canteen</h2>

    <p>
      there’s a quiet urgency, compounded by the general discomfort. a number of people are at the canteen, some of them {{name}} recognises.
    </p>

    <div id="characterDescriptions"></div>

    <p>
      they look back to the entrance and see {{friend}}. {{name}} waves at them. {{friend}} smiles back, and makes their way to {{name}}. if they are affected by the space the way {{name}} was, their body language doesn’t show it. the light slowly starts to dim. {{friend}} is right on time. the event is about to begin. a spotlight shines on the canister. {{name}} makes their way from the canteen to the centre of the room, along with everyone else.
