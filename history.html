    <h2>History of Utopia</h2>

    <p>
      the year is 2070. it's been fifteen years since governments of the world relinquished all sovereign power to "Utopia," an AI conglomeration optimised to take all the right decisions for life on earth to flourish. governments were increasingly desperate after the Resource War in the 2030s. multiple genocides resulted in rampant impoverishment, violence and exploitation. capitalism: the snake, had grown larger and larger and greedier and greedier until it finally swallowed itself whole.
    </p>

    <p>
      the war ended with a peace treaty that brought a number of leading AI tech companies together to spearhead the current AI technocracy by pooling their knowledge and eliminating competition. something had to be done about regulating whatever resources were left in order to save the planet. everyone believed tech was gonna save them. they had to pin their hopes on something, and this is what they did. humans couldn’t sit and waste time engaging in blame game — they’d have to do whatever was most efficient for all life, afraid that they would remain a blip in deep time.
    </p>

    <p>
      and so, Utopia does everything. healthcare, the housing crisis, unemployment, even the military, etc. the generally accepted and agreed upon truth is that the AI knows best — better than any biased human ever could, at least — and so, if it chooses to alter history, and therefore memory, it is not something one can know, nor want to. when the collective social conscience is already okay with Utopia doing stuff like military organising, what does it matter if it picks and chooses what humans get to remember? it's better this way. it's when humans remember that they hurt. it's easier to forget.
