      hi! i’m the words on your screen speaking on behalf of the writer of the story (who is with you right now). if you have any questions, ask them. if something doesn’t make sense in the story, <b>definitely</b> ask them.
    </p>

    <p>
      now let’s get into it. at the end of the google form you just filled, you had to rank characters. here’s why you did that — your top pick is the main character of this story, and your second choice is the bad guy. in the next page, you get to pick them. 
    </p>

    <p>
      i hope you have fun writing this story!
    </p>
